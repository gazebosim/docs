# Ignition Roadmap

This page describes planned work for Ignition. The set of planned
features and development efforts should provide insight into the overall
direction of Ignition. If you would like to
see other features on the roadmap, then please get in touch with us at
info@openrobotics.org.

## Quarterly Roadmap

## 2021 Q3 (Jul - Sep) / Q4 (Oct - Dec) - ongoing

* **Scripting**: Add scripting interfaces to Ignition
    * [All open tickets](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aignitionrobotics+label%3A%22scripting%22&state=open&type=Issues)
    * [Status](https://github.com/orgs/ignitionrobotics/projects/3?card_filter_query=label%3A%22scripting%22)

## Feature Roadmap

A number of features are planned for specific releases of Ignition. The
features listed here derive from the Quarterly Roadmap, listed above, and other
ongoing projects.  See the [Release Features](/docs/all/release-features) page
for a list of features already available in each release of Ignition.

A named release of Ignition, such as Acropolis or Blueprint, is tied to
a set of [library](/libs) major versions. Our
[development and release pattern](/docs/all/releases) allows us to distribute
patch and minor updates into a stable Ignition version. For example, if a new
feature does not break API/ABI then we will target the feature to the oldest
compatible non-EOL release and propagate the feature forward.
