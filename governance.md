# Governance

The Gazebo project, a project under the Open Source Robotics Foundation, is
managed by the Open Source Robotics Alliance (OSRA). The OSRA-appointed
Technical Governance Committee provides oversight of the project, while the
Project Management Committee is responsible for day-to-day operations. This
document outlines these entities and their respective roles and
responsibilities. For further information, please refer to
[OSRA website](https://osralliance.org/how-it-works/).

## Open Source Robotics Alliance (OSRA)

The Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) established the Open Source Robotics
Alliance (OSRA) to enhance the governance of its open-source projects including
Gazebo. Inspired by the success of organizations like The Linux Foundation and
the Eclipse Foundation, OSRA aims to provide funding, encourage greater
community involvement, and ensure the long-term stability of these projects. The
OSRA has a Technical Governance Committee that oversees the technical aspects of
the projects.

## Technical Governance Committee (TGC)

The TGC provides guidance and oversight to each of the projects. Its
responsibilities include approving proposed activities of each Project
Management Committee (PMC), approving Project Leader nominations, and reporting
to the OSRF Board on the activities of the OSRA and status of each project.

## The Gazebo Project Management Committee (PMC)

The Gazebo PMC is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Gazebo
project including setting the projectâ€™s roadmap, coordinating development
activities from individual contributors, and facilitating community engagement.
The PMC is also responsible for electing the Project Leader and approving PMC
member and committer nominations. The PMC consists of the Project Leader,
Members (individuals with full voting rights), a Supporting Individual
Representative, and the Chair of the TGC.

## Committers

The Gazebo project also has committers. These are individuals who have commit
access to one or more of the Gazebo repositories and help the PMC maintain the
project by contributing code, reviewing pull requests, and responding to issues,
etc. While committers typically don't have voting rights within the PMC and
aren't considered PMC members, it's possible to hold both roles. Conversely, all
PMC members are required to be committers.

## Current Gazebo PMC Constituents

The Gazebo PMC currently consists of the following individuals:
