# Getting Started with Ignition?

Welcome to Ignition!

If you're here and not quite sure what Ignition is all about, then
you might want to give the [Overview](/docs/all/overview) page a quick read.

When you're ready, follow the next few steps to get up and running with
simulation using Ignition.

## Step 1: Install

Each release of Ignition ships with a new installation tutorial. You can
read [the latest installation tutorial here](/docs/latest/install). Please
visit the [main documentation](/docs) pages for a list of all releases,
along with links to their respective installation tutorials.

## Step 2: Run

After installing Ignition in Step 1, you can launch Gazebo, a 3D robotics
simulator, from a terminal using

```
ign gazebo shapes.sdf
```

This command will launch both the Gazebo server and Gazebo GUI with a world
that contains three simple shapes.

Add the `-v 4` command line argument to generate error, warning,
informational, and debugging messages on the console.

```
ign gazebo shapes.sdf -v 4
```

Gazebo can also be run headless, i.e. without the GUI, by using `ign-gazebo-server` instead of `ign gazebo`. For example,

```
ign-gazebo-server -f shapes.sdf -v 4
```

Similarly, the GUI can be run independently using `ign-gazebo-gui`. On
start, the GUI will attempt to connect to an `ign-gazebo-server` instance.
If a server is not available, then you will see just a blank screen until
a server instances is started.

## Step 3: Create your own world

[SDF](http://sdformat.org/) is used to specify the contents of simulation.
Take a look at the available [SDF tutorials](http://sdformat.org/tutorials)
to get started.

Modifying an existing SDF world is also a good way to get started. Ignition
Gazebo ships with a number of [example SDF
worlds](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/blob/main/examples/worlds)
that you can freely copy and modify. These example SDF files are
installed. Many of the SDF files also have instructions located at the
top of the SDF file. The instructions typically contain information about how to
run Gazebo with the SDF file in order to experience a particular feature.

There are a wide variety of simulation resources at your disposal on
[https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/fuel](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/fuel).
If you find a model you'd like to use, then click on the `<>` icon in the
model description page, highlighted in the image below, to copy an SDF
snippet into your clipboard. This snippet can be pasted directly into your
custom SDF file.

## Step 4: Explore and learn

This tutorial has covered the basics of getting started with Ignition.
Starting with Citadel, there are more [versioned tutorials](/docs/citadel/tutorials)
covering the basics of the GUI, creating worlds and robots, and more.

Each [Ignition library](/libs) also has a set of tutorials and
examples. Explore these resources, and don't forget to ask questions and
find solutions at [answers.gazebosim.org](http://answers.gazebosim.org).
