# Data and Privacy Policy

The Fuel service provides a convenient mechanism to share simulation assets.
An important aspect involves the collection and distribution of data. This
privacy policy defines what information is collected and how that
information is used.

## Information we collect

We are not striving to be an information broker. To that end, we securely
store the minimal amount of information necessary to create a functional
service, and we do not share or distribute private information.


## Information you give to us

This includes assets, such as 3D meshes, as well as some user information,
such as email addresses during the sign up process. We explicitly do
not store passwords. The user information we collect uniquely
identifies a person, and is required by many of the features we
provide by this web service.


## Information we get from your use of our services

We collect meta-data, such as models that you have liked and downloaded.
This information is used to provide a better user-experience. We do not sell
or use this information for ads or marketing.


## Inappropriate Content

Content may be immediately removed if it

  * contains images that do not represent the actual data,
  * violates copyright law (See our [Copyright](/docs/latest/fuel_copyright) and [Fair Use](/docs/latest/fuel_fair_use) pages), or
  * contains inappropriate material including but not limited to spam, marketing material, or sexually explicit content.
