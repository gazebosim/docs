# Contributing a New World

A world consists of a description of global properties and a set of models
that populate the environment. The description format is [SDF](http://sdformat.org/), and you can
find example worlds at [https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/worlds](https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/worlds). Worlds can be used by simulators to launch and simulate models in a specific environment.

You can upload a new world to Gazebo by completing the form on [https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/worlds/upload](https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/worlds/upload). The upload form allows you to specify a name for the world, along with a description and tag data.
