# Contributing a New Model

The easiest way to contribute a new model is via [https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/models/upload](https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel/models/upload).

Fuel assumes that a model conforms to [Gazebo's model structure](https://gazebosim.org/api/sim/8/meshtofuel.html). At minimum,
a model must have model.config and model.sdf files. Image thumbnails
can be placed in a thumbnails subdirectory. These images will be
displayed on this website when viewing the model.
