## Physics

In Ignition Physics, physics engines are integrated as plugins, so any engine
can be integrated without changing the core source code, as it was the case
in Gazebo.

## ROS integration

ROS integration with Ignition will be done primarily via a
transport bridge instead of plugins, contained in the
[ros_ign](https://github.com/osrf/ros1_ign) package.

* **ROS 1**: See full message list at [ros_ign](https://github.com/osrf/ros_ign)
* **ROS 2**: Available from Blueprint
