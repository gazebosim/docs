# Launch Gazebo from ROS 2

Gazebo can be launched from a ROS 2 launch system in multiple ways:

## Using the launch files included in
[ros_gz_sim](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/tree/ros2/ros_gz_sim).

The package `ros_gz_sim` contains two launch files named `gz_server.launch.py`
and `gz_sim.launch.py`. You can use them to start Gazebo server or Gazebo (server and GUI)
respectively.

```bash
ros2 launch ros_gz_sim gz_sim.launch.py gz_args:=empty.sdf
```

Or you can just start the server:

```bash
ros2 launch ros_gz_sim gz_server.launch.py world_sdf_file:=empty.sdf
```

Consult the argument block of each launch file
[here](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/blob/ros2/ros_gz_sim/launch/gz_sim.launch.py.in#L75-L96)
and [here](https://github.com/gazebosim/ros_gz/blob/ros2/ros_gz_sim/launch/gz_server.launch.py#L27-L38)
to learn about the different parameters that are accepted by each launch file.

## Using a custom launch file.

### XML
It's also possible to start Gazebo from your custom launch file. For that
purpose we have created the custom `<gz_server/>` tag that can be used from your
XML launch file. In this case, the arguments are passed as attributes
within this tag. Here's an example for launching Gazebo server:

```xml
<launch>
  <arg name="world_sdf_file" default="empty.sdf" />
  <arg name="world_sdf_string" default="" />
  <arg name="container_name" default="ros_gz_container" />
  <arg name="use_composition" default="True" />
  <gz_server 
    world_sdf_file="$(var world_sdf_file)"
    world_sdf_string="$(var world_sdf_string)"
    container_name="$(var container_name)"
    use_composition="$(var use_composition)">
  </gz_server>
</launch>
```

In this case the `<gz_server>` parameters are read from the command line. That's
an option but not strictly necessary as you could decide to hardcode some of the
values.

### Python
Python launch files provide more low-level customization and logic compared to XML launch files. 
In the following example, the user can specify a world argument to launch an environment for
the Moon, Mars, or Enceladus. It additionally sets the resource path environment variable and
sets up empty arrays for topics to be bridged and remapped from Gazebo to ROS 2:
```python
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import (DeclareLaunchArgument, SetEnvironmentVariable, 
                            IncludeLaunchDescription, SetLaunchConfiguration)
from launch.substitutions import PathJoinSubstitution, LaunchConfiguration, TextSubstitution
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource


def generate_launch_description():
    pkg_ros_gz_sim = get_package_share_directory('ros_gz_sim')
    pkg_spaceros_gz_sim = get_package_share_directory('spaceros_gz_sim')
    gz_launch_path = PathJoinSubstitution([pkg_ros_gz_sim, 'launch', 'gz_sim.launch.py'])
    gz_model_path = PathJoinSubstitution([pkg_spaceros_gz_sim, 'models'])

    return LaunchDescription([
        DeclareLaunchArgument(
            'world',
            default_value='moon',
            choices=['moon', 'mars', 'enceladus'],
            description='World to load into Gazebo'
        ),
        SetLaunchConfiguration(name='world_file', 
                               value=[LaunchConfiguration('world'), 
                                      TextSubstitution(text='.sdf')]),
        SetEnvironmentVariable('GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH', gz_model_path),
        IncludeLaunchDescription(
            PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(gz_launch_path),
            launch_arguments={
                'gz_args': [PathJoinSubstitution([pkg_spaceros_gz_sim, 'worlds',
                                                  LaunchConfiguration('world_file')])],
                'on_exit_shutdown': 'True'
            }.items(),
        ),
        Node(
            package='ros_gz_bridge',
            executable='parameter_bridge',
            arguments=[],
            remappings=[],
            output='screen'
        ),
    ])
```
