# Ignition Releases

This page details the set of past and planned releases.

## What is a Release?

A release of Ignition consists of a set of versioned [Ignition Libraries](/libs). Each library follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), and the major version of a library is guaranteed not to change with an Ignition release. This essentially means you can develop code against a release of Ignition without the worry of breaking changes being made upstream.

### Naming Scheme

An Ignition release follows the form "Ignition Codename", for example Ignition Acropolis. The codename is alphabetically increasing, and chosen to fall loosely within the architectural domain.
