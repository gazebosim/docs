# ROS Integration

Most of the Ignition libraries use [Ignition Transport](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-transport)
to exchange data between different software components. This tutorial details
how to interface with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), enabling the ability to use
tools such as [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) for robot or sensor
visualization.

> **Important**: The packages documented here used to have the `ros1_` prefix
> instead of `ros_`. Please update your code accordingly in order to avoid
> adverse effects.

# ros_ign_bridge to the rescue

ros_ign_bridge provides a network bridge which enables the exchange of messages
between ROS 1 and Ignition Transport. Its support is limited to only certain
message types. Please, read this [README](https://github.com/osrf/ros_ign/blob/noetic/ros_ign_bridge/README.md)
to verify if your message type is supported by the bridge.

# How to install ros_ign_bridge

## Binary install

Binaries are not yet supported for Dome. Check out the [table on ros_ign](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign) for other combinations.

## Source install

See the [from source](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign#from-source) of the bridge documentation. This tutorial requires Ubuntu Bionic or newer.

# Run the bridge and exchange images

In this example, we're going to generate Ignition Transport images using Gazebo, that will be converted into ROS 1 images, and visualized with rqt_viewer. It is assumed that you are using ROS Noetic.

First we start a ROS 1 `roscore`:

```bash
# Shell A:
. /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
roscore
```

Then we start Gazebo.

```bash
# Shell B:
ign gazebo -r camera_sensor.sdf
# if you don't see the camera image in the Image Display and it stays grey, press the orange refresh button
```

Gazebo should be running and publishing images over the `/camera` topic.
Let's verify it:

```bash
# Shell C:
ign topic -l | grep "^/camera"
```

Then we start the parameter bridge with the previous topic. To run the bridge:

```bash
# Shell D:
. /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
# If installed from source, make sure you've sourced the ros-ign packages too
rosrun ros_ign_bridge parameter_bridge /camera@sensor_msgs/Image@ignition.msgs.Image
```

Now we start the ROS 1 GUI:

```bash
# Shell E:
. /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-rqt-image-view
rqt_image_view /camera
```

You should see the current images in `rqt_image_view` which are coming from
Gazebo (published as Ignition Msgs over Ignition Transport).

The screenshot shows all the shell windows and their expected content
(it was taken using ROS Noetic):
