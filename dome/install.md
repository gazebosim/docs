# Dome Installation

Dome supports the following platforms:

 * Ubuntu Bionic and Focal on amd64/i386
 * MacOS Mojave and Catalina
     * Ignition currently only works in headless mode
      (GUI does not render; instead of using `ign gazebo fuel.sdf` command, use
      `ign gazebo -s fuel.sdf` to start the server only).

Windows support is still experimental although most of the packages should work
as expected. There are no binaries for Windows at this time. The `ign-gazebo`
package is still not available for Windows; the installation should be done from
source code. The [Source Installation on Ubuntu](install_ubuntu_src)
contains some tips for Windows.

## Binary installation instructions

Nightly builds are available for Linux.

 * [Binary Installation on Ubuntu](install_ubuntu)
 * [Binary Installation on MacOS](install_osx)

## Source Installation instructions

Source installation is recommended for users planning on altering Ignition's source code (advanced).

 * [Source Installation on Ubuntu](install_ubuntu_src)
 * [Source Installation on MacOS](install_osx_src)

## Dome Libraries

The Dome collection is composed of many different Ignition libraries. The
collection assures that all libraries are compatible and can be used together.

This list of library versions may change up to the release date.
