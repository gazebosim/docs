# Overview

Web visualization supports rendering and interacting with running
Gazebo simulations. You may find web visualization useful
when interacting with remote or headless Gazebo Sim simulations. No
additionally dependencies, other than a browser and internet connection, are
required.

Instructions for setting up a websocket server and gzweb visualization can
be found in the
[gz-sim websocket server tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/sim/10/websocket_server.html).
